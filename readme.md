# Civic Connect
### By the Full Stack Citizens

## The Web App
Civic Connect allows users to browse and submit templates for topics that concern them.
Users can also submit templates if they wish to share a template they've created or obtained elsewhere.
The app also has a built-in representative finder, which allows them to find out who represents them in government, so that they have people to send the template to.

## Submitting Templates
Once a user is logged in using any Google account, they can submit a template by simply navigating to the submission page, and inputting their topic and text.
Once a template is submitted, administrators can check and approve it if they deem it appropriate for the site.
In the meantime, users can check the status of any templates they've submitted on their user page.

## Browsing Templates
The "Search Templates" page will show all approved templates.

## Finding Your Representative
Finding representatives is easy, all you have to do is input a US address on the "Find Your Reps" page, and the page will display all reps found using Google Civic Information API.
Any information found about a government official will be shown under their name, including address (to send letters) and email if publicly available.
Unfortunately, due to the way GCI returns information, their position is not shown, but since most officials have websites, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out their position.
